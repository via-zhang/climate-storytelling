# Over the Years, a Climate Storytelling 2075 Project

## Sea Level Change
Visualizing local sea level data from the [NOAA tide-monitoring station](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/stations.html) at Virginia Key, Florida, near my home in Southeast Florida. More information is available at the [CO-OPS Relative Sea Level Trends Tool](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/features/interactive-map-how-has-local-sea-level-united-states-changed-over-time).

There is an upward trend in the lines, indicating sea level rise." width="500">

The graph shows sea level change (relative to the mean sea level from 1983â€“2001) in Virginia Key, Florida for each month from 1994 to 2023. The color indicates the year: darker colors indicate more recent sea levels up to 2023, and ligher colors indicate sea levels closer to 1994. There is a prominent rise in sea level for the observed region (Virginia Key, Florida), and similar trends of sea level rise is seen in many other regions.

## Projected Sea Level Rise
Visualizing projected sea level rise, up to 10 feet in elevation, in a part of the Everglades in South Florida. The sea level depth data is from the [NOAA Office for Coastal Management's (OCM) Sea Level Rise Viewer](https://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/tools/slr.html), showing sea level rise inundation for 0 ft to 10 ft above Mean Higher High Water (MHHW) for Southeast Florida.

The map below shows the region included in the final artwork, with [state boundary lines](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=774019f31f8549c39b5c72f149bbe74e) from the U.S. Census Bureau provided by Esri. The satellite image is a composite Sentinel-2 image from March to May 2024 downloaded using the `rsi` package in R developed by Michael Mahoney.

## Poem
```
over the years
I can feel
the thrashing
in my heartbeat
as veins of
seagrass unfurl
against the ocean's
restless rise
we know we must
rise higher
```
I wrote this poem in reflection of my fear and hope surrounding the climate crisis.
